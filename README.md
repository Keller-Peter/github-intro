# Intro to GitHub for non-coders

GitHub is a useful tool, not only for collaborating on program code, but also for collaborating on all kind of other documents, in particular on text documents. You don't have to be a programmer or know about all the features of GitHub to do this productively. In this intro we try to explain what you need to know to do this.

This repository has a two-fold purpose. It contains the material with explanations of the intro and it serves as a playground for experimenting with GitHub. As an example we will use [cooking recipes](recipes). Feel free to play around, you can't break anything.
