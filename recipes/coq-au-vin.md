## Ingredients

* 1.5 kg chicken pieces (thighs, legs, and breasts), skin-on
* 150g bacon, cut into small strips
* 250g pearl onions, peeled
* 250g mushrooms, quartered
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 750 ml dry red wine (Burgundy or Pinot Noir)
* 250 ml chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 60 ml brandy
* A few sprigs of fresh thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Olive oil for frying
* Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Prep and Brown the Chicken:**
   * Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat some olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces, skin-side down, and cook until browned on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.

2. **Sauté the Bacon and Vegetables:**
   * In the same pan, add the bacon and cook until crisp. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms, sautéing until they are golden brown. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.

3. **Deglaze and Simmer:**
   * Pour in the brandy to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Add the chicken back to the pan along with the red wine, chicken stock, tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is tender.

4. **Thicken the Sauce:**
   * In a small bowl, mix the flour with a bit of water to make a smooth paste. Stir this into the stew to thicken the sauce. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

5. **Serve:**
   * Remove the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Garnish with fresh parsley before serving. Enjoy this classic French dish with mashed potatoes, noodles, or a crusty baguette to soak up the delicious sauce.

Savor the Orient Express Coq au Vin as a celebration of the opulence and culinary delights that define luxury rail travel through Europe.
