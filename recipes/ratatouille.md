# TGV Ratatouille

Inspired by the swift travels of France's TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse), this recipe offers a vibrant, high-speed take on the traditional French vegetable stew. It embodies the efficiency and flair of the TGV, delivering a delicious taste of Provence right to your table.

## Ingredients

* 1 medium eggplant (aubergine), cut into 2 cm cubes (about 250g)
* 2 medium zucchinis (courgettes), sliced into 2 cm thick rounds (about 300g)
* 1 red bell pepper, chopped into 2 cm pieces
* 1 yellow bell pepper, chopped into 2 cm pieces
* 2 medium onions, chopped
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 400g can of whole peeled tomatoes, crushed
* 60 ml olive oil
* A handful of fresh basil leaves, torn
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano

## Instructions

1. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   * Heat half of the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the eggplant and zucchinis, cooking until they start to soften, about 10 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the pot and set aside.

2. **Cook Onions and Peppers:**
   * In the same pot, add the remaining olive oil, onions, and bell peppers. Sauté until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and oregano, cooking for another minute until fragrant.

3. **Combine and Simmer:**
   * Return the eggplant and zucchinis to the pot. Add the crushed tomatoes and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover and let it cook for about 20 minutes, or until all vegetables are tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. **Garnish and Serve:**
   * Stir in the fresh basil just before serving. Serve hot as a side dish or over a bed of cooked quinoa or rice for a hearty main course.

Enjoy this TGV Ratatouille as a celebration of French cuisine and the speedy elegance of high-speed rail travel. It's a perfect dish for bringing a taste of Provence to your kitchen, no matter how far you are from France.
